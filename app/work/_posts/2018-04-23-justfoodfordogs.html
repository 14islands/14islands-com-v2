## More life. More years. More love.

We were brought on the mission to create longer and healthier lives for dogs. It’s all about picking fresh ingredients with the correct nutritions for each dog, in proper amounts. Because every dog has different needs we created a personalised experience that recommends the best recipe to every customer depending on their dog’s profile.

Dogs bring tons of love and joy to their owners and we wanted to show that same personal feeling and playfulness in every step of the experience. At the same time, we wanted to communicate transparency and expertise that play a big part in the quality of JustFoodForDog's products. We paired detailed pictures of the real food with animations and some dog love to show personality and bring the service to life.

## A personalised meal plan

On signup, the service recommends a recipe by leading the customers through some simple questions about their dog. We wanted that flow to be a delightful moment for the owners, where they learn fun facts about their pets and get all relevant informations they want to know about the recipes and their dog’s needs. More than the recipe, the recommendation engine calculates quantities based on energetic needs, frequency of delivery and estimated delivery dates.

## Good food and playful animations are the secret to a happy dog life.

The idea was to give people the feeling of how it’s to live with Parkinson. Everyday tasks can become a struggle, such as switching a lightbulb or put a tooth paste on your brush. The game makes precision pretty difficult as vibrations come break the tasks the user needs to accomplish.

## Creative Tech

This project featured a true separation of concerns with the front-end communicating with a custom build API.

We used the most interesting and suiting stack we could think of wich also made coding this a lot of fun :)
